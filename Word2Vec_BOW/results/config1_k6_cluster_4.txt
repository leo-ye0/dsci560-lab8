1. Bottlebrush particles deliver big chemotherapy payloads directly to cancer cells Outfitted with antibodies that guide them to the tumor site the new nanoparticles could reduce the side effects of treatment
   Keywords: tumor, reduce, antibodies, directly, effects, cells, guide, nanoparticles reduce

2. We ve glimpsed the secret quantum landscape inside all matter
   Keywords: matter, glimpsed, landscape, inside, quantum, secret

3. New pathway engineered into plants lets them suck up more CO2 Engineered pathway lets carbon be plugged directly into key metabolic pathways
   Keywords: pathways, pathway, engineered, suck, lets, plants, directly, plugged

4. Caged drugs still STING cancer but make treatment much safer The new drug delivery system only activates when inside a tumor and calls upon the body s own immune system to destroy it
   Keywords: inside, safer, drug, body, calls, destroy, immune, sting

5. A new study shows that a personalized precise form of brain stimulation HD tDCS can rapidly ease depression symptoms and even reduce anxiety offering a promising drug free alternative with only mild side effects
   Keywords: effects, rapidly, reduce, free, symptoms, shows, stimulation, personalized

6. Magnesium the microbiome and reducing the risk of colon cancer Magnesium supplements may prevent colon cancer by boosting specific gut bacteria
   Keywords: cancer, magnesium, risk, colon, specific, microbiome, reducing, boosting specific

7. Inflammation jolts sleeping cancer cells awake enabling them to multiply again
   Keywords: multiply, enabling, cancer, awake, cells, inflammation, jolts, sleeping

8. Tumor targeting Salmonella engineered to boost colon cancer survival Scientists have engineered a species of Salmonella that self destructs inside colon cancer tumors
   Keywords: cancer, engineered, colon, scientists, salmonella, destructs, boost, species

9. New 3D bioprinting technique may improve production of engineered tissue
   Keywords: tissue, technique, production, bioprinting, engineered, improve

10. Bottlebrush particles deliver big chemotherapy payloads directly to cancer cells
   Keywords: cells, directly, cancer, chemotherapy, payloads, bottlebrush, deliver, particles

11. Notorious Alzheimer s protein also supercharges cells against cancer Scientists have found that a byproduct of amyloid beta rejuvenates T cells boosting their tumor fighting power and dramatically reducing cancer risk
